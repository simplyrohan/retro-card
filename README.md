# Retro Card
A tiny console to run all your favorite retro consoles

# Emulators
While I'm still implementing these, the planned emulators for this project are
 - [ ] NES
 - [x] GBC/GB
 - [ ] SMS

# To Do
 - [ ] Use real nofrendo
    - [ ] NES Emulator is based on NESCAT but because of me chopping it up and the one-file source code, the code is horrendous right now
